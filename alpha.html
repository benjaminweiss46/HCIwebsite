		<h4>
			The app is now designed to run with Google Meet as opposed to Zoom
		</h4>

		<p>
			Having switched to a Chrome Extension, we realized that it was no longer possible for our application to
			read the Zoom chat data. As a result, we have decided to switch our video conferencing platform of choice to
			Google Meet, in order for all of our desired features to be feasible.
		</p>

		<h4>
			Changed from a Java app to Chrome Extension
		</h4>

		<p>
			In the formative feedback, the point was made that not all of our target users will necessarily be
			comfortable with running a Java app through the command line. Recognizing that this is in fact true, we
			found that switching to a Chrome extension would solve this issue, as they are much easier to run. Also, the
			users noted that the app was quite intrusive and couldn't be resized. Now as a Chrome extension, the app
			takes up very little room on the screen and is easily opened/hidden by clicking the extension icon.
		</p>
		<p>
			This change thus satisfies our first usability goal, which states that "the system should seem familiar and
			therefore be quickly usable", because Chrome extensions should seem more familiar to users than Java apps,
			so they should be able to use them more quickly.
		</p>
		<p>
			The home page of the extension is much smaller than our previous version of the app, so it is much less
			intrusive. Also, the extension is available across different tabs in Chrome browser. The host can screen
			share a tab of their Chrome browser in Google Meet. For example, they can be sharing a youtube video in
			another tab in Chrome, while still being able to see the homepage of our extension and incoming messages.
			This change therefore satisfies our third usability goal, "the system should not obstruct the users view of
			Google Meet and in turn not be too annoying".

		</p>

		<h4>
			Removed the chat option from the app
		</h4>

		<p>
			In the formative feedback, the chatting feature within the app was also identified as a usability issue.
			Thus, from a usability perspective, we figured it would be easier for users if we just removed the chat
			aspect from the app, and left all the chatting actions to the video conferencing software. (Note this refers
			to the user typing in the chat, a chat log will still be visible). Furthermore, since the app is now a
			Chrome extension, we figured it would be even more confusing than before if we were to keep the chat within
			the app.
		</p>
		<p>
			This decision also makes implementing all of our other features more feasible, since we can now focus more
			on them instead of the chat, which isn't as important.
		</p>
		<p>
			This change was made in order to satisfy our first usability goal, since having the chat in the app impaired
			the quick usability of the app. Users were confused when the "Send Message" message in the chat box wasn't
			disappearing when they wanted to type a message. This confused the users and thus did not satisfy this goal.
		</p>
		<p>
			If users are allowed to send messages in our extension, then the message history shown in Google Meet and in
			our extension will be inconsistent. This decision also ensures the consistency throughout our product,
			therefore achieves "Consistency and Standards" in heuristic evaluation.

		</p>

		<h4>
			Removed the "Record Answers" button and the selecting messages feature
		</h4>

		<p>
			A major point that was brought up in the formative feedback was the confusion surrounding the "Record
			Answers" button and the selecting messages feature. A lot of the usability concerns and suggested
			improvements revolved around these two features. As a result, we decided to remove both features and instead
			implement their functionalities in a more automated way, to improve usability and reduce the level of
			confusion for users. As for recording answers, the app will simply always record the chat. For selecting
			messages, the app will try to identify clusters of messages that go together.
		</p>
		<p>
			This change once again satisfies the first usability goal. These two features were the main source of
			confusion in our system, so removing them allows for the app to be much more user friendly. These features
			also violated our fifth usability goal, which states that "the system should offer feedback as data comes
			in". These features were confusing mainly because they didn't offer any feedback when they were used in the
			computer prototype. Thus, by removing them, this usability goal is no longer violated.

		</p>

		<h4>
			Removed the "preview" page, and "selecting visualization type" page
		</h4>

		<p>
			We removed the "preview" page, so that the virtual distance from the home page to the visualization page is
			much shorter. In this way, when the host feels that the visualization is not ideal, they can simply click on
			the "Back" button on the visualization page, and they will be directed back to the home page to start a new
			visualization. Also, we removed the "selecting visualization type" page, instead, we put different
			visualization methods as buttons directly on the homepage.
		</p>
		<p>
			The users now can cancel the unwanted outputs easily, without having to go through the redundant process of
			traveling back and forth between homepage, preview page, selecting visualization type page, and finally, the
			visualization page. This change enables us to achieve "User control and freedom" of the heuristic
			evaluation.
