		<h4>
		Changed from a Java app to Chrome Extension
		</h4>

		<p>
		In the formative feedback, the point was made that not all of our target users will necessarily be comfortable
		with running a Java app through the command line. Recognizing that this is in fact true, we found that switching
		to a Chrome extension would solve this issue, as they are much easier to run. Also, the users noted that the app
		was quite intrusive and could not be resized. Now as a Chrome extension, the app takes up very little room on the
		screen and is easily opened/hidden by clicking the extension icon. Overall, this change was justified from a
		usability perspective, as it will now be easier to run the app, which in turn allows more users to use it.
		</p>

		<h4>
		Removed the chat option from the app
		</h4>

		<p>
		In the formative feedback, the chatting feature within the app was also identified as a usability issue. Thus,
		from a usability perspective, we figured it would be easier for users if we just removed the chat aspect from
		the app, and left all the chatting actions to the video conferencing software. Furthermore, since the app is now
		a Chrome extension, we figured it would be even more confusing than before if we were to keep the chat within
		the app. This decision also makes implementing all of our other features more feasible, since we can now focus
		more on them instead of the chat, which is not as important.
		</p>

		<h4>
		The app is now designed to run with Google Meet as opposed to Zoom
		</h4>

		<p>
		Having switched to a Chrome Extension, we realized that it was no longer possible for our application to read
		the Zoom chat data. As a result, we have decided to switch our video conferencing platform of choice to Google
		Meet, in order for all of our desired features to be feasible.
		</p>

		<h4>
		Removed the "Record Answers" button and the selecting messages feature
		</h4>

		<p>
		A major point that was brought up in the formative feedback was the confusion surrounding the "Record Answers"
		button and the selecting messages feature. A lot of the usability concerns and suggested improvements revolved
		around these two features. As a result, we decided to remove both features and instead implement their
		functionalities in a more automated way, to improve usability and reduce the level of confusion for users. As
		for recording answers, the app will simply always record the chat. For selecting messages, the app will try to
		identify clusters of messages that go together.
