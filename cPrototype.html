		<h4>Slow Chat</h4>
		<p>The slow chat button was a feature that allowed to slow down the chat recieved by zoom. This is done so the host never misses a comment at the expense of a potential delay on the hosts chat. While this option was good in practice if confused users in testing who didn't understand what this button did. Even with some explination some users didn't get what it really did. So thi was completely removed.</p>
		<h4>Tool Tips</h4>
		<p>While we may have believed our interface was so easy to use it needed no explination. This proved to be incorrect, some user had no idea what to do. To combat this we have included tooltips on some of the buttons to indicate what actions the button performs.</p>
		<h4>More Options</h4>
		<p>While we wanted have more than 4 graph options, and give users maximal optionality we didn't give them a way to get more in practice. Therefore we added a button to the graph options so that users can select from a much larger range of options.</p>
		<h4>Graph Customization</h4>
		<p>We initially expected users to customize the graphs by clicking on graph elements. Not many users understood this interation. Therefore we moved graph customization to its own section, with labels and input boxes so users know exactly how to customize the graph.</p>
		<h3 id="cPre">Computer Prototype</h3>
		<p>Below you will find the download link for our computer prototype. This is a very initial developement of our product but should carry all needed features for testing. The only features it currently missing is, creating the graphs from the chat data, getting chat data from the zoom servers and finding answers to consider in the chat. Please excuse some of the more janky aspects of application as it is still in developement. Focus on the usibility of the interface instead. Hope you enjoy.</p>
