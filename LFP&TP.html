		<h3 id="usa">Usibility Goals & Benchmark Tasks</h3>
		<h3>Usibility Goals</h3>
		<p><b>1. The system should seem familiar and therefore be quickly usable.</b></p>
		<p>Users should demonstrate profeciency with the system almost immediately after playing with it for a few moments. Buttons and labels should suggest the appropriate path for actions the user wants complete.</p>
		<p><b>2. The system should be highly customizable.</b></p>
		<p>The visualizations, the applications layout, and the chat should all be easily changed at the users request.</p>
		<p><b>3. The system should not obstruct the users view of zoom and in turn not be too annoying.</b></p>
		<p>The system should be a helping hand to presenters and a tag along to Zoom therefore it cannot take away from the software it aims to help.</p>
		<p><b>4. The system should offer the user a high level of optionality, by default, that is easy to find (without them having to manually make it so).</b></p>
		<p>Multiple options should be offered to a user who doesn't want to manually customize anything. Many preset viewtypes and visualization options.</p>
		<p><b>5. The system should offer feedback as data comes in.</b></p>
		<p>Users shouldn't need to guess what the output will look like they should have an idea of what it will look like before they select there visualization.</p>

		<h3>Benchmark Tasks</h3>
		<p>You will find all the below benchmarks tasks test usibility goal 1 (specifically). The ability to perform all these tasks without training could prove how quickly learnable our system is.</p>
		<p><b>1. The user asks a simple yes or no question</b></p>
		<p>This refers to goal 1 (especially), a yes or no question is the basic option of our software and users should be able to do this quickly with almost no experiance.</p>
		<p><b>2. The user can look at what his data looks like in multiple formats before choosing a visualization.</b></p>
		<p>This is there to test usibility goal 5 we want no guess work from the user they should know what their visualization will look like with the data coming in before it is selected.</p>
		<p><b>3. The user can manually customize and/or fix charts</b></p>
		<p>Relating to goal 2 the user should be able to customize the software output to their wishes.</p>
		<p><b>4. The user can select/find the alternative chart types to view data.</b></p>
		<p>Relating to usibility goal 4 the user should be able to find multiple preset chart types to visualize data.</p>
		<p><b>5. The user can find/interact with/follow zoom chat within our application.</b></p>
		<p>Following from usibility goal 3. We don't want our aplication to take away from zoom therefore we included a chat function. This should serve just as well as the zoom chat.</p>
