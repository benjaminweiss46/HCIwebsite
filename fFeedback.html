		<h3 id="um">Testing of Group 20</h3>
		<p>Following the parameters set out by group 20 all results were sent to them on online surveys, making it very
			difficult to show the results. The documents pretest survey, post-test survey and data collection sheet
			where
			all done in forms sent to group 20. We have requested these documents from group 20 for proof if they were
			able to provide them you should see them below. Three tests were performed by our group following group 20's
			specifications. <br><br>
			Joe Shlomo: A fake name given for one of our roommates, who was the first test subject. Joe Shlomo is a very
			shy individual, who rarely raises his voice and most definitely does not turn on his camera in class. In
			fact he does not go to many classes as he is afraid a teacher may force him to turn his camera on or speak.
			Only going to lectures when participation is worth marks and in those cases hiding himself best he can. This
			fulfills group 20's request of a target audience of individuals who attend online events but are too shy to
			participate with the current channels. Joe did fill out a consent form for his data though it is omitted for
			obvious privacy concerns.</p>

		<h3 id="de">Test Plan Critique</h3>
		<h5>Lack of Tests for Some Usability Goals</h5>
		<p>There were no tests to check on usability goals 1. detecting facial expression must be fast and 2. detecting
			facial expression must be accurate. I am aware this is hard to do since they are impossible to test in a
			Framer prototype. Though if they are your usability goals they need to be tested so many you should have
			chosen another prototype method, like producing a bare bones application in some language so that this
			becomes testable.</p>
		<h5>Testing Assumes Long Distance Remote Testing</h5>
		<p>This is fair given the times we are currently living in, though I tested my shy roommate who happened to fall
			into the target demographic. In this situation I had to make some assumptions on how to perform the tests.
			Therefore you should add statements such as, "If in person you may do x instead" or write a completely
			different testing document for in person tests vs long distance tests (though the first method is definitely
			easier).</p>
		<h5>Test Script Improvement</h5>
		<p>The test script never mentions showing the user the user manual first before the test. I realize you
			mentioned they should read it on the website but it should be included in the test script as well. One of my
			teammates even asked if they needed to show their subject the user manual first which is why it most
			definitely should be included in the test script.</p>
		<h5>Context for Test 1</h5>
		<p>Test 1, "Search for Rowan Atkinson" becomes very confusing because Rown Atkinson is already the first option
			in the left hand window and the search bar doesn't yet work. A user looked at me and said, "he's right
			there." It doesn't really test the usability goals of "The software should be convenient to use" because no
			task really needs or can be performed in reference to the search bar. If the test was search for someone
			lower down, who is not immediately accessible it would actually help tell you if users can quickly find a
			certain person from the list, but since Rowan is at the top nothing is really being tested. Solutions could
			be as mentioned change the person the first test refers to, to someone not immediately visible, get the
			search bar to work in the prototype, or instruct evaluators to scroll down so Rowan isn't visible before the
			first test.</p>
		<h3 id="de">Design Critique</h3>
		<h5>Possible Change 1</h5>
		<p>To delete a default you have to delete the image in the above avatar window. This was a source of confusion
			for the delete default test. You would expect deletion options for defaults to be in the defaults window.
			Maybe add a deletion option in the defaults window as well as in the avatar window.</p>
		<h5>Possible Change 2</h5>
		<p>For operations such as removing/adding a favourite and deleting a image. You actually have to select the item
			you want to perform an operation on before performing the operation. In the two tests relating to these
			tasks, test subjects went to the still visible star/trash icons even though they weren't selected and tried
			performing the operation and were confused when it did not work. Maybe just hide these options unless the
			item is selected or if that doesn't fit with the usability goal of "easy to understand" just allow users to
			perform these operations without first selecting the item. If they click on the star for example, note that
			they clicked on the star for person x and immediately star that one.</p>
		<h5>Possible Change 3</h5>
		<p>The default set up is a large area for improvement. Selecting a default is as easy as clicking on a selected
			picture for one of the emotions. Though this can easily lead to problems. What if I want to select a certain
			face but I don't want it as one of my defaults? Instead maybe implement a button to select the current
			active face as a default. This refers to the test where a user added an item to the defaults and was
			wondering why it only took one click. The user commented I guess,"I just did the task." I can only imagine
			the users confusion came from not knowing how it could be so easy, realizing it could be a problem if they
			wanted to select an image but didn't want it as a default.</p>
