		<h3 id="um">Testing of Group 20</h3>
		<p>Following the parameters set out by group 20 all results were sent to them on online surveys, making it very difficult to show the results. The documents pretest survey, posttest survey and data collection sheet where all done in forms sent to group 20. We have requested these documents from group 20 for proof if they were able to provide them you should see them below. Three tests were performed by our group following group 20's specifications. <br><br>
			Joe Shlomo: A fake name given for one of our roommates, who was the first test subject. Joe Shlomo is a very shy individual, who rarely raises his voice and most definetely does not turn on his camera in class. In fact he does not go to many classes as he is afraid a teacher may force him to turn his camera on or speak. Only going to lectures when participation is worth marks and in those cases hiding himself best he can. This fulfills group 20's request of a target audience of individuals who attend online events but are too shy to participate with the current channels. Joe did fill out a consent form for his data though it is ommited for obvious privacy concerns.</p>
